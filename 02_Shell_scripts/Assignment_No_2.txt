Theory:
             1) What is Shell (Linux kernel architecture diagram)
             2) Different types of shells

Problem statements for shell scripting:
2a) Write a shell script to check user is root user or not
        [HINT:  study "id" command in linux]
2b) Write a shell script to install any particular software (ex: java or python)
2c)
Write a shell script to check disk usage of the system and if disk
usage is more than 90% it should send an email to system admin. This
script should run everyday at 8:00 AM.

        [HINT:  study "du", "sed", crontab, mail in linux]
2d) write a shell script to take mysql database server backup. This script should run weekly on every sunday at 11:00 PM.
        [HINT: study "mysql" dump, crontab in linux]
